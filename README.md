   Q : "What are the Software Development Kits for Android?"
   A : The main Software Development Kit (SDK) for Android is
       the Android SDK, a toolbox from Google containing APIs,
       libraries, debuggers, emulators, and sample code, primarily
       managed within the official Android Studio IDE for building,
       testing, and debugging apps.

       Key components include the Android NDK (Native Development Kit
       for C/C++), platform tools like ADB, and libraries for various
       features, all designed to support app development across diverse
       Android devices and versions

When I first started this I downloaded something called "Android SDK
Hedgehog" (from Google).  I pushed my way through to make a "hello-world"
app and loaded it on my old `SAMSUNG Galaxy Express 3`.

I'm trying to repeat that and then start writing more apps.

However, this was all done on my CentOS 8, which bombed out during an
update.  And CentOS was being tombstoned (for some unknown reason) so
I switched over to Ubuntu.
